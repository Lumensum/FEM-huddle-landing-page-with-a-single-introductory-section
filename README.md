## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- BEM

### What I learned

I wanted to try using the BEM Naming Convention. I think it would be a good exercise since this is all new to me and another coder on Frontend Mentor suggested it as a good new learning step.

I also tried to use rem as much as possible instead of fixed pixel numbers.

Also I am trying to use this README.md for the second time to document parts of my process and learning.

### Continued development

I still need more practice with the BEM Naming Convention. I will use other Frontend Mentor Challenges to get a better understanding of it.

### Useful resources

- [http://getbem.com/naming/](http://getbem.com/naming/) BEM Naming Convention- I tried using this information for the class-names. It is still a bit hard for me since it is very new, but I think I made some progress and will ask for feedback on Frontend Mentor.

- [https://autoprefixer.github.io/](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) Autoprefixer CSS online - I used this to make sure my CSS works in most browsers.
